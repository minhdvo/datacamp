The vote for the Civil Rights Act in 1964
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was one of the most important pieces of legislation ever passed in the USA. 
Excluding "present" and "abstain" votes, 153 House Democrats and 136 Republicans voted yea. 
However, 91 Democrats and 35 Republicans voted nay. Did party affiliation make a difference in the vote?

To answer this question, you will evaluate the hypothesis that the party of a House member has 
no bearing on his or her vote. You will use the fraction of Democrats voting in favor as your 
test statistic and evaluate the probability of observing a fraction of Democrats voting in favor 
at least as small as the observed fraction of 153/244. (That's right, at least as small as. I
n 1964, it was the Democrats who were less progressive on civil rights issues.) To do this, 
permute the party labels of the House voters and then arbitrarily divide them into "Democrats" 
and "Republicans" and compute the fraction of Democrats voting yea.

# python code
# Construct arrays of data: dems, reps
dems = np.array([True] * 153 + [False] * 91)
reps = np.array([True] * 136 + [False] * 35)

def frac_yea_dems(dems, reps):
    """Compute fraction of Democrat yea votes."""
    frac = np.sum(dems) / len(dems)
    return frac

# Acquire permutation samples: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = draw_perm_reps(dems,reps, frac_yea_dems, 10000)

# Compute and print p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates <= 153/244) / len(perm_replicates)
print('p-value =', p)

Result p =0.0002
This small p-value suggests that party identity had a lot to do with the voting. 
Importantly, the South had a higher fraction of Democrat representatives, 
and consequently also a more racist bias.
